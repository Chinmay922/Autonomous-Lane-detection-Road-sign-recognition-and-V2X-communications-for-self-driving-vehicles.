# Autonomous Lane detection and Road sign recognition for self driving vehicles

# Overview
The objevctive of this project is to design an algorithm for detecting lanes, calculating steering angle and distance from other vehicles using camera in a self driving vehicle. The atonomus vehicle should also detect road traffic signs and act accordingly. Also, implementing an intutive HMI to show the steering moment.
The road sign recognition and autonomous lane recognition cab be run on two different computers or same computers and data between the two programs will be communicated in real time. This was a project from one of projects but the data was already given then whereas in this project i will be collecting data by mounting a camera on a real vehicle and calculating all the above mentioned parameters. 
Calculting the distance between the near-by vehicles and using a kinect camera to analyze the environment will be a new addition to my previous project.
Carrying out this function using MATLAB/ROS/Python.
Using a Microsoft Kinect camera with IMU and depth sensor which helps to find out the distance from other vehicles.
